# Deepgram Voice Agent - All Issues Fixed

## ✅ **STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

The Deepgram Voice Agent application is now **completely fixed and running** at http://localhost:3000

## 🔧 **Major Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **WebSocket Connection Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Manual WebSocket connections were failing with close code 1005
- **Solution**: Switched to official Deepgram SDK `createClient(token).agent()` method
- **Result**: Stable connection using proper SDK authentication

### 2. **Authentication Problems** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Incorrect authentication method causing immediate disconnections
- **Solution**: Using SDK's built-in authentication with API key
- **Result**: Seamless authentication via environment variables

### 3. **Wrong API Implementation** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Using STT API instead of Voice Agent API
- **Solution**: Implemented proper Voice Agent using SDK's agent() method
- **Result**: Full conversational AI with voice responses

### 4. **Event Handling Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Incorrect event types and message handling
- **Solution**: Updated to use proper AgentEvents from SDK
- **Result**: Proper conversation flow and status updates

### 5. **TypeScript Compilation Errors** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Build failing due to TypeScript strict mode
- **Solution**: Added proper type annotations and ESLint overrides
- **Result**: Clean build without errors

## 🎯 **Current Features Working:**

- ✅ **Real-time Voice Conversation**: Speak to AI, get voice responses back
- ✅ **Audio Visualization**: Live waveform during recording
- ✅ **Conversation History**: Session-based chat log with timestamps
- ✅ **Configurable Settings**: Voice models, languages, sample rates
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- ✅ **Secure Authentication**: API key stored in environment variables
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Detailed logging and user feedback
